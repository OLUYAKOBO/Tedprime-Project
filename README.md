# Tedprime-Project

This project is a project I did when i was interning at TedPrime Tech_hub
Basically,the program is a password decoder and encoder.
So,the user inputs a password and instead of displaying the password in the form it was written, I created a program that allows the user to generate random passwords and i created another program to return it into the form it was input by the user.
I used Tkinter,so there is a little bit of user interactivity.
